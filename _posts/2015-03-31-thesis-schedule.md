The pre-defense is around the corner. I have to start writing my thesis, right now.

I need a plan.

My thesis is entitled as "Fast and Controllable Simulation of Complex Deformable Materials". The expected structure of the thesis is as follows:
1. Introduction
2. Fundamentals
3. Numerical Coarsening of Nonlinear Inhomogeneous Materials
4. Dynamically Enriched MPM for Invertible Elasticity
5. Example-based Materials in Laplace-Beltrami Shape Space
6. Anisotropic Kernels for Meshless Elastic Solids
7. Conclusions

Chapter 4, 5, 6 would be fast, since they're either published or submitted. I'm guess 4 days would be enough for these chapters. Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 are the hard bones. Chapter 1 should describe briefly the content of this thesis, and highlight the contributions of my research. I'll spare 1 day for this chapter. Chapter 2 presents the fundamental theories employed in this thesis, it should be well-written and self-contained. I need to read some good thesis of others so that I can make it good. 4 days for this chapter. Chapter 3 worries me most because the research is not finished yet. I'm working to submitted it before April 15th, probably SCA. As for now, I need to finish the code as soon as possible, produce results, and write the paper.

So, here is the time schedule for the next 15 days:

+ Thesis Writing:
  - Chapter 1: April 2th
  - Chapter 2: April 6th
  - Chapter 3: April 15th
  - Chapter 4: April 7th
  - Chapter 5: April 8th
  - Chapter 6: April 9th
  - Chapter 7: April 10th
+ Homogenization Project:
  - finish basic coding: April 2th
  - demo production: April 10th
  - paper writing: April 2th - April 15th

Try my best to stick to the plan.
