title: Solve for Harmonic Displacements with FEM Discretization
---

For comparison reasons, I need to implement the SIGGRAPH2009 paper [Numerical Coarsening of Inhomogeneous Elastic Materials](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~owhadi/publications/KMOD09.pdf). Everything else was set up except the harmonic displacements $ \{h_{\alpha\beta}\}_{1 \le \alpha \le \beta \le d} $:

Here is an example MathJax inline rendering $ 1/x^{2} $, and here is a block rendering: 
$$ \frac{1}{n^{2}} $$
