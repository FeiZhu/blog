title: Solve for Harmonic Displacements with FEM Discretization
---

For comparison reasons, I need to implement the SIGGRAPH2009 paper [Numerical Coarsening of Inhomogeneous Elastic Materials](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~owhadi/publications/KMOD09.pdf). Everything else was set up except the harmonic displacements \\( \{\bm{h}_{\alpha\beta}\}_{1\leq\alpha\leq\beta\leq d} \\):
