title: What's this blog for?
---

I tried to blog before, never made it for long. I guess the reason is that I wasn't so clear what I was blogging for. Record my daily work, share my thoughts, or something else? Anyway, I'm setting up another blog here on github and start fresh. The intent of setting up this blog is to push forward my work. I read somewhere online that using a blog to record the progress of what you're doing can help get the work done. Since I always have multiple tasks to do at the same time, I decide to use this blog as a log of what I'm doing.

Here's what I need to do recently:
* Write a tiny ARPG game with cocos2d
* Write my Phd thesis
* Start a new research project, try to submit a paper by the end of May

For the cocos2d assignment, I decide to write a game based on DragonBall. Here's what I have in mind: the game is about Goku finding the dragon ball. There're seven levels in the game, each level with a boss. Goku needs to defeat all the enemies before meeting the boss of each level. After beating the boss of one level, he gets a dragon ball. Something like that, I'll go into the details in later posts.

The thesis needs to be done before April 20th. The content of the thesis would be focussed on "fast and controllable simulation of complex deformable models". More specifically, it's about my papers:
* Example-based Materials in Laplace-Beltrami Shape Space (published)
* Dynamically Enriched MPM for Invertible Elasticity (submitted)
* Numerical Coarsening of Nonlinear Inhomogeneous Materials (in preparation)
* BEM Simulation of Nonlinear Elasticity (considering)

I need to start a new research project and get it submitted by the end of May. The research should appear as part of my thesis. I'm working on that. The project would either be about BEM or Peridynamics, I haven't decided yet.
